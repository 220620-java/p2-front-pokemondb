                Barney has invented something that looks to Fred like a giant egg beater, but it's a flying machine. Fred feigns illness so that he and Barney can get out of "opera night" with the girls

            <p class="flintstones">The Flintstones is an American animated sitcom produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions. 
                The series takes place in a romanticized Stone Age setting and follows the activities 
                of the titular family, the Flintstones, and their next-door neighbors, the Rubbles. 
                It was originally broadcast on ABC from September 30, 1960, to April 1, 1966, and 
                was the first animated series to hold a prime-time slot on television.
                The show follows the lives of Fred and Wilma Flintstone and their pets Dino and 
                Baby Puss, eventually seeing the addition of baby Pebbles Flintstone. Also featured 
                are relatives Pearl Slaghoople and Uncle Tex Hardrock. The Rubbles are close 
                characters to the Flintstones, including Fred's best friend, Barney Rubble, and his 
                family, Betty Rubble, Bamm-Bamm Rubble and their pet, Hoppy.

            <p class="flintstones">
                Producers William Hanna and Joseph Barbera drew inspiration for the show's concept 
                and music from popular cartoons of that time, including The Bugs Bunny Show and Tom 
                and Jerry, as well as from the live-action comedy series, The Honeymooners.
            </p>

            <p class="flintstones">
                The continuing popularity of The Flintstones rests heavily on its juxtaposition 
                of modern everyday concerns in the Stone Age setting. The Flintstones was 
                the most financially successful and longest-running network animated television 
                series for three decades, until The Simpsons surpassed it in 1997. In 2013, 
                TV Guide ranked The Flintstones the second-greatest TV cartoon of all time 
                (after The Simpsons).
