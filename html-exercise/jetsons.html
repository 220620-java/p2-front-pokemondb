            <h1>The Jetsons</h1>
            <p>The Jetsons is an American animated sitcom produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions. 
                It originally aired in prime time from September 23, 1962, to March 17, 1963, on 
                ABC, then later aired in reruns via syndication, with new episodes produced 
                from 1985 to 1987. It was Hanna-Barbera's Space Age counterpart to <a href="flintstones.html">The Flintstones</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                While the Flintstones lived in a world which was a comical version of the Stone Age, with machines powered by birds and dinosaurs, the Jetsons live in a comical version of a century in the future, with elaborate robotic contraptions, aliens, holograms, and whimsical inventions. The original had 24 episodes and aired on Sunday nights on ABC beginning on September 23, 1962, with prime time reruns continuing through September 22, 1963. It debuted as the first program broadcast in color on ABC. (Only a handful of ABC stations were capable of broadcasting in color in the early 1960s.) In contrast, The Flintstones, while always produced in color, was broadcast in black-and-white for its first two seasons. The show was scheduled opposite Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color and Dennis the Menace and did not receive much attention; it was cancelled after one season and moved to Saturday mornings, where it was very successful.
