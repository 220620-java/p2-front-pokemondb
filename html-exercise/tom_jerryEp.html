                The Yankee Doodle Mouse is a 1943 American one-reel animated cartoon in Technicolor.<br>
            It is the eleventh Tom and Jerry short produced by Fred Quimby, and directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera,<br>
            with musical supervision by Scott Bradley and animation by Irven Spence, Pete Burness, Kenneth Muse and <br>
            George Gordon. Jack Zander was credited on the original print, but his credit was omitted in the 1950 reissue. <br>
            It was released to theaters on June 26, 1943 by Metro-Goldwyn Mayer. The short features Tom the cat and Jerry <br>
            the mouse chasing each other in a pseudo-warfare style, and makes numerous references to World War II <br>
            technology such as jeeps and dive bombers, represented by clever uses of common household items. <br>
            The Yankee Doodle Mouse won the 1943 Oscar for Best Animated Short Film, making it the first of seven <br>
            Tom and Jerry cartoons to receive this distinction.<br>
